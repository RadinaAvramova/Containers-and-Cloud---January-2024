Summary :

With Docker we can create and manage images,containers, volumes, etc.

▪ Image == read-only template with instructions
for creating a Docker container

▪ Container == a runnable instance of an image

▪ Volumes == the preferred mechanism for persisting data

▪ We can run apps in containers

▪ We can also have a working database in a container
